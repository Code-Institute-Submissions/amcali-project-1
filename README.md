Portfolio - Arwa Ali

Milestone Project - User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project 

This is my website to present a portfolio for myself. As I do not have any work experience to share, I generated a list of software related skills I have learnt and projects to present on my website. The aim of the website is to essentially target any talent seekers, or any individuals or organisations which would like to contact me for any collaborations.

UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
I generated a simple design for my website, and aimed for a clean set of colours to complement one another. Prior to designing my website, I viewed other portfolio websites from which I decided to choose lighter colours for legibility purposes, and to complement the projects that were presented. In addition, the colour choices aimed to give the user a feel of my character.
