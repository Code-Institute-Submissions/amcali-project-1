# Portfolio - Arwa Ali #

## Milestone Project - User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project ##

This is my website to present a portfolio for myself. As I do not have any software related work experience to share, I generated a list of software related skills I have learnt and projects to present on my website. The aim of the website is to essentially target any talent seekers, or any individuals or organisations which would like to contact me for any collaborations.


## Demo ##
A live demo can be found [here] (https://www.github.com/amcali/project-1)


## UX ##
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
I generated a simple design for my website, and aimed for a clean set of colours to complement one another. Prior to designing my website, I viewed other portfolio websites from which I decided to choose lighter colours for legibility purposes, and to complement the projects that were presented. In addition, the colour choices aimed to give the user a feel of my character. 

Through interactive components such as the UX and the multimedia contents and links presented, the website is to give more the user an understanding of my skills.


## Features ##
My website has the following features:

### Navigation ###
The navigation bar has been placed to stay at the top of the webpage. The links it contains link up to the respective sections on the webpage:
* Home
* About Me
* My Skills
* My Projects
* Contact Me

### Home ###
This section is featured by a Bootstrap jumbotron. It contains a hero image, which was taken from pexels: 
https://www.pexels.com/photo/row-of-black-and-gray-polished-pebble-on-gray-surface-940271/

The motto "Stepping stones pebble milestones. Milestones mine gemstones." was created by myself. The idea was inspired on the thought of taking small steps at a time to achieve greater goals. The text shadow feature was incorporated from the website: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow
A screenshot of the coding is available here: https://github.com/amcali/project-1/issues/1

The hero image and the motto aims to give the user an idea of my persona.
The intention of using the jumbotron was to give the website the ability to be mobile responsive; as a homepage, the image was to act as a home screen.

### About Me ###
This is a brief and simple outline describing what I am currently pursuing and something that describes what I do in my past time.
This section was created using a container and placing the text and image into different rows.
I used the Boostrap feature of columns and rows to ensure the section could adapt as much as possible to being mobile responsive.
The coding template was adapted from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/#equal-width-multi-row

### My Skills ###
This section used Bootstrap buttons and had been linked with anchors to the respective explanation of the software skill stated.
The purpose of this was to serve to users who are not familiar with software skills what each of the skills were.
The links were all taken from Wikipedia website:

* HTML: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML
* CSS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets
* Bootstrap: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)
* Java: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)
* JavaScript: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript
* SQL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL

The buttons were arranged into rows and columns which used Boostrap, as it helped to incorporate media responsive design to the section:

        <div class="row align-items-center p-2">
          
          <div class="p-2 col">
            <a class="btn btn-outline-danger" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" role="button">HTML</a>
          </div>
          <div class="p-2 col">
            <a class="btn btn-outline-primary" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank" role="button">CSS</a>
          </div>
          <div class="p-2 col">
            <a class="btn btn-outline-dark" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)" target="_blank" role="button">Bootstrap</a>
          </div>
          <div class="p-2 col">
            <a class="btn btn-outline-info" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank" role="button">Java</a>
          </div>
          <div class="p-2 col">
            <a class="btn btn-outline-secondary" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" role="button">JavaScript</a>
          </div>
          <div class="p-2 col">
            <a class="btn btn-outline-info" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank" role="button">SQL</a>
          </div>


### My Projects ###
This section used the Bootstrap Card as an illustration means to portray the projects displayed. 
The coding template was adapted from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/card/ : 

<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Card subtitle</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
    <a href="#" class="card-link">Card link</a>
    <a href="#" class="card-link">Another link</a>
  </div>
</div>

All photos displayed in the cards were taken from Pexels:

## Features Left To Implement ##
I would like to have the contact form to be linked to my email, so that I would be able to receive any messages sent via the form.
I would like to have a means of validating the field contents prior to the message being sent.


## Another feature idea ##
I would like to in future be able to have actual projects portraited in place of the current ones in "My Skills" section.


## JQuery ##
No immediate usage of JQuery was used in this project.


## Testing ##
I have tested the appearance of my webpage on different media device screens to ensure presentation is appropriate according to the media device size.


## Deployment ##
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, and it is deployed directly from the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.
